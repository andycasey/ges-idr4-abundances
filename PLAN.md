Figures for each element
========================

Systematics in stellar parameters?
----------------------------------

- All abundances for this element (y-axis) against effective temperature (x-axis)
- All abundances for this element (x-axis) against surface gravity (x-axis)


Qualitative comparisons against existing studies
------------------------------------------------

- [X/H] (y-axis) against [Fe/H] (x-axis) with Bensby abundances in the background 
- [X/H] (y-axis) against [Fe/H] (x-axis) with (1) Bensby abundances and (2) all other nodes in the background (greyed)


Line-to-line scatter
--------------------

- Residuals of one line abundance compared to mean abundance (y-axis) against radial velocity (x-axis) to look for lines impacted by tellurics
- Histogram showing the percentile of one line abundance with respect to the distribution of abundances for a given star. This should show "where" a line always sits in a distribution of abundances for a given line (is it always high, always low, or spread everywhere?)
- Node-to-node scatter for one line compared to the node-to-node scatter for an element (show as histograms) 
- Are some lines saturating (and the broadening not being treated correctly)? Show node-to-node scatter for a given line (y-axis) with respect to the reduced equivalent width

Node-to-node scatter
--------------------
- Corner plots showing abundances from all nodes, compared to each other.
- Distributions showing node-to-node scatter from node A to all other nodes.
- Distributions showing node-to-node scatter from node A to all other nodes, as grouped by the radiative transfer code used.


Equivalent widths
-----------------
- Equivalent width comparisons between each node for the given element (all measurements for this element).
- Equivalent width comparisons for a given line.


Which lines were used?
----------------------

- Heat map showing all the lines used for a given element.
- Heat map showing all the lines used for a given element, coloured by the logarithm of the line-to-line scatter.
