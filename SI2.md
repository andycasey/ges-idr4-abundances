SI2
===

Abundances for `SI2` have been submitted from 3 WG11 nodes (`EPINARBO`, `Lumba`, `MyGIsFOS`), and equivalent widths (EW) are available from one node (`EPINARBO`). The EW sample has a hard cut at 120 mA, so there are no EWs larger than this. There are only 2 `SI2` transitions available: `6347.1` and `6371.4`.

There are lots of figures available [here](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~arc/ges-idr4/SI2/), but I have just shown the most relevant ones here.

Mean abundances
---------------

Here are the mean `SI2` abundances (per star):

Line abundances
---------------

Below are the individual line abundances for `SI2`. Each transition is shown in a different row, and the wavelength of the line is shown in the top of the center panel of a given row. In the left panel the normalised distribution of absolute (`log(X)`) abundances are shown for the entire WG11 sample (black). The normalised distribution of absolute abundances for the individual line (e.g., 6347.1) are shown in red. The number of measurements in each distribution is quoted. 

The center and right-hand side panels show differential (node-to-node for a given star/spectrum) abundances for all stars in the sample. Again the black distribution shows the full normalised distribution of node-to-node comparisons, and the red shows the normalised distribution of node-to-node comparisons for the given line. The mean and standard deviation of the differential distribution (including all lines) is shown in the center-top panel.

In the right-hand panel, the differential (node-to-node for a given star/spectrum) abudances are shown for all stars in the sample, but each distribution is shown for a given node. For example, the blue distribution in the top-right panel shows the distribution of `log(X)_{EPINARBO} - log(X)_{ANY OTHER NODE}` abundances. In each case, the distributions are shown such that a positive deviation implies the coloured node returns systematically higher abundances than all other nodes. The number of measurements in each normalised distribution is shown. The mean and standard deviation of differential abundances for this given line is shown.

**Do the deviations correlate with REW?**
